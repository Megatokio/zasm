; #target p  /  #target 81
;
; "p" and "81" files are the same and used when saving ZX81 programs.
; The file consist of the raw ram data as saved by the ZX81 tape saving routine WITHOUT the filename.
; The file can only store one program, not a whole tape with multiple programs.
; The data is save from and loaded back to address $4009++.
;
; #target p81
;
; ".p81" files consist of the raw data as saved by the ZX81 tape saving routine INCLUDING the filename.
; This format can store multiple programs.
; "p81" files are like "p" and "81" files preceded with the program's name.
; The file start with the 1..127 bytes filename, last byte ORed with $80,
; which is exactly what is actually saved by the ZX81 tape saving routine.
;
; --------------------------------------------------------------------
; A ZX81 program is stored like this on a real audio tape:
;
;       x seconds    video noise
;       5 seconds    silence
;       1-127 bytes  filename (bit 7 set in last char)
;       LEN bytes    data, loaded to address $4009, LEN = ($4014)-$4009.
;       1 pulse      video retrace signal if display was enabled
;       x seconds    silence / video noise
;
; --------------------------------------------------------------------
; Notes:
;       The data contains system area, basic program, video memory, VARS.
;       the last byte of a (clean) file should be $80 (the last byte of VARS)
;
;       $4014   defines the end address (used to calculate the file length)
;       $4029   points to the next executed (autostarted) BASIC line
;       $403B   indicates if program runs in SLOW or FAST mode (bit 6)
;       $403C++ may be misused for whatever purpose,
;       video memory must contain 25 HALT opcodes if the file was saved in SLOW mode.
;
;       While loading, the data at address $4014/4015 (E_LINE) is overwritten. After this they contain
;       the real data end address of the data loaded and define when loading will stop. :-)
;
;       Files should usually not exceed 16 kBytes.
;       The memory detection procedure in both ZX80 and ZX81 stops after 16 kBytes (at $8000)

                    ;           POKE 16384,n can be used to force an error halt: 0 … 14 gives one of the usual reports,
                    ;           15 … 34 or 99 … 127 gives a nonstandard report, and 35 … 98 is likely to mess up the display file.

                    ;           that area (see Chapter 26) or to fool CLS into setting up a minimal display file.

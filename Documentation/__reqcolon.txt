H5	--reqcolon, .reqcolon
p	Related command line option, pseudo instruction and predefined label

p	Select syntax variant where colons ':' are required after program label definitions.
p	Normally colons are not required and the assembler decides whether a name is a label definition or something else by the position where it starts: label names must start in column 1 and instructions must be preceded by some space.

p	This example must not be compiled with --reqcolon or --dotnames:
pre	.org 0					; due to the dot this pseudo instruction is allowed in column 1
	foo		equ	0xF00		; label definition
	bar:	and	a			; program label def and a instruction
			jp	foo			; instruction
	shelf	db	0			; program label def and a pseudo instruction

p	But some source files don't obey this widely accepted rule and put instructions in column 1 or – actually seen – start label definitions indented with some tabs.
p	As long as only pseudo instructions starting with a dot are put in column 1 and option --dotnames is not required, this is no problem. In all other cases you need this option --reqcolon and, of course, then colons are required after program label definitions, but still not after other label definitions with 'equ' and the like:

p	This example must be compiled with --reqcolon:
pre	; funny indented:
	org 0						; 'org' would be recognized as a label without --reqcolon
		foo		equ	0xF00		; label definition
		bar:	and	a			; program label def and a instruction
	jp	foo						; instruction
		shelf:					; program label definition
	.db	0						; a pseudo instruction

p	Prior to version 4.3.4 a label _reqcolon_ was also defined.

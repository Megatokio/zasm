p	This pseudo instruction inserts a block of <value1> bytes into the current code or data segment. The default fill pattern is $FF for ROMs and $00 for all other target formats. If you append a <value2>, this byte is used as pattern instead.

p	If the current segment is a data segment, then no fill pattern is allowed, as no actual code is stored.

p	Instruction 'data' is only allowed in a data segment and therefore it can never have a fill pattern assigned.

p	Multitiple names are recognized to support sources for different assemblers. <tt>defs</tt> or <tt>ds</tt> are recommended, the others are deprecated for new source.

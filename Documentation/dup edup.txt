p	DUP and EDUP were introduced as an alias for REPT and ENDM in version 4.1.4.
		
p	This pseudo instructions defines a sequence of source which shall be stored into code multiple times. By use of a redefinable label the stored values may even be adjusted slightly. This is a lightweight form of an ad-hoc macro.

p	The names with or without dot may be used interchangeable.

p	Assembler directives (starting with '#') are not allowed inside macros.

p	Examples:

pre	; from the source of dzx7_lom:
		DUP		3
		ldi
		add		a
		jr		c, dzx7l_process_ref
		EDUP

pre	v	defl	0
		DUP		8
		ld		a, regs2 + v/2
	v	defl	v+2
		cp		a, v
		jr		nz, 0
		EDUP

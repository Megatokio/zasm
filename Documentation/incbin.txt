h3	incbin


pre		incbin <filename>

p	Inserts a binary file. The file name must be given as an absolute path or relatively to the current source file.
p	The file's contents are just copied into the code segment verbatim.

h5	Examples:

pre		incbin "image.gif"    	; file in same directory
		incbin "./image.gif"  	; file in same directory
		incbin "pics/g1.gif"  	; file in subdirectory "pics/"

p	This pseudo instruction does the same as the assembler directive #insert:

pre	#insert "image.gif"     	; file in same directory

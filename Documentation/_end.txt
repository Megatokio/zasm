h3	#end
	
pre	#end



p	Define the logical end of your source.

p	<tt>#end</tt> must not be inside an <tt>#if</tt> branch or in a <tt>#local</tt> scope. This is so that using <tt>#end</tt> does not disable the test for a missing <tt>#endif</tt> or <tt>#endlocal</tt>.

p	Anything after #end is ignored by the assembler.

p	Alternate syntax:

p	zasm also accepts 'end' as a pseudo instruction:

pre		end
p	or
pre		.end

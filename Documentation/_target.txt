h3	#target

pre	#target	<name>

p	The #target directive defines the kind of output file. If no #target directive is given in the source, then zasm will default to a rom file. The #target directive must occur before any #code definition and any opcode. Best put it directly at the start of the source. The <name> defines the extension of the output file. Depending on the desired target your source must consist of multiple #code segments. See section about target files. The #target directive is required if you include c source files, because the c compiler requires code and data segments.

p.b	<name> is one of:

pre	ram		plain binary data, presumably to be loaded into ram
	bin		old name for target 'ram'
	rom		plain binary data, presumably for a rom
	sna		ZX Spectrum NMI snapshot
	z80		ZX Spectrum snapshot
	tap		ZX Spectrum or Jupiter Ace tape file
	o		ZX80 tape file
	80		ZX80 tape file
	p		ZX81 tape file
	81		ZX81 tape file
	p81		ZX81 tape file
	ace		Jupiter Ace snapshot file

p	Only target ram and rom can be written as Intel hex or Motorola S-Record file. All other file types can only be written as binary file. This is controlled by the comand line options '-x' or '-s'.

p.b	Simple source file example:

pre	#target rom
	;
	#code	_ROM0,0,4000h
	;
	; <-- your code goes here -->
	;
	#end

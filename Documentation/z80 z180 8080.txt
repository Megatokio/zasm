h3	.z80, .z180 and .8080
	z80, z180, 8080
	
pre		.z180
		.org 0
		...
	
p	These pseudo instructions declare the type of processor and <tt>.8080</tt> also the assembler syntax in use. They are related to the command line options --z80, --z180, --8080 and --asm8080. These instructions overload the command line options. They must occur befor the first 'org' instruction or segment definition.

h5	Target cpu z80
pre		.z80
p	Declare the source to be for a Z80. This is the default, so it is normally never required.
p	<tt>.z80</tt> cannot override a '--8080' or '--asm8080' given on the command line but will fail with an error if the target is not a Z80 or Z180.

h5	Target cpu z180
pre		.z180
p	Declare the source to be for a Z180 or HD64180. 
p	The additional instructions are enabled and all illegal instructions are disabled.
p	<tt>.z180</tt> can upgrade from target cpu Z80 to Z180, but cannot override a '--8080' or '--asm8080' given on the command line. Basically it allows you to omit the '--z180' option on the command line.

h5	Target Intel 8080
pre		.8080
p	Use 8080 assembler syntax and declare the source to be for a Intel 8080 cpu. 
p	This is more like command line option '--asm8080' because it also selects 8080 assembler syntax.
p	In 8080 assembler, label names are not case sensitive, it implies '--casefold'.

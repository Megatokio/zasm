h3	.z80, .z180 and .8080
	z80, z180, 8080

pre		.z180
		.org 0
		...

p	These pseudo instructions declare the type of processor and <tt>.8080</tt> also the assembler syntax in use. They are related to the command line options --z80, --z180, --8080 and --asm8080. These instructions can be used to replace the command line options. They must occur befor the first 'org' instruction or segment definition.

p	These pseudo instructions will fail if another cpu was already selected on the command line.
p	Note: the behavior slightly changed in version 4.3.4.

h5	Target cpu z80
pre		.z80
p	Declare the source to be for a Z80. This is the default, so it is normally not required.

h5	Target cpu z180
pre		.z180
p	Declare the source to be for a Z180 or HD64180.
p	The additional instructions are enabled and all illegal instructions are disabled.

h5	Target Intel 8080
pre		.8080
p	Use 8080 assembler syntax and declare the source to be for a Intel 8080 cpu.
p	This is more like command line option '--asm8080' because it also selects 8080 assembler syntax.
p	In 8080 assembler, label names are not case sensitive, it implies '--casefold'.

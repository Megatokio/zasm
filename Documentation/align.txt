	align

pre		align <value> [, <fillbyte>]
p	e.g.:
pre		align 8

p	Add fill bytes until the current logical address is a multiple of the given value.

p	Base for the alignment is the current logical code address, as accessible with '$'. 

p	Positive addresses can be aligned to any value. If you happen to organize your addresses from -0x8000 to +0x7FFF then negative addresses can only be aligned to 2^N.

p	If only one argument is given, then 'align' inserts the default fill byte; 0xFF for target ROM and 0x00 for all others.

p	If a different fillbyte is required, then it can be appended as a second argument.

pre		align $100, 'E'|0x80

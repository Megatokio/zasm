p	This pseudo instructions defines a sequence of source which shall be stored into code multiple times. By use of a redefinable label the stored values may even be adjusted slightly. This is a lightweight form of an ad-hoc macro.

p	The names with or without dot may be used interchangeable.

p	Assembler directives (starting with '#') are not allowed inside macros.

p	Starting with version 4.1.4 the names "DUP" and "EDUP" are also accepted for "REPT" and "ENDM".

p	Example:

pre		rept	$2000 - $
		defb	0
		endm

p	Which does the same thing as 'defs $2000-$' or even 'org $2000'. Just more complicated.

pre	v	defl	0
		rept	8
		lda		regs2 + v/2
	v	defl	v+2
		cpi		v
		jnz		0
		endm

p	This seems to be 8080 assembler source. <b>B-)</b>

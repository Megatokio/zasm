h3	macro, .macro, endm and .endm
	macro, endm

p	'macro' starts a macro definition and 'endm' terminates it. Macros are assigned a name by which they can later be used at the place of an ordinary instruction.

p	There are quite numerous formats used by different assemblers and zasm tries to support at least some of them out of the box. In the following code examples the instruction names with or without a dot can be used interchangeably.

p	Frequently you need some kind of label in a macro, but you cannot redefine ordinary labels. Frequently this can be solved with redefinable labels which are defined with 'defl' or 'set'.

p	Since version 4.2.5 expressions between '{' and '}' are evaluated and replaced with the resulting text. This can be used to generate label names. The expression must be evaluatable in pass 1 because macro replacement is done in pass 1.

p	It is possible to conditionally exclude portions of the macro by use of the pseudo instructions 'if' and 'endif'. (<u>not</u> '#if' and '#endif'!)

p	Assembler directives (starting with '#') are not allowed inside macros.


h5	Define a simple macro without arguments

pre	<name> 	macro
			<instr>
			...
			endm

p	Alternate syntax:

pre			macro <name>
			<instr>
			...
			endm

p	Example:

pre	counter	defl	0
	COUNT	.macro
	counter	defl counter + 1
			.endm
	 
			...
	 
			COUNT
	 
			...
	 
	final_count	equ	counter

p	This defines a counter for something, e.g. Forth words if your source happens to be a Forth interpreter. It uses a redefinable label which is redefined every time the macro is used in the source. The final value of the redefinable label is only really the final value at the end of your source. In order to use it somewhere before, potentially befor the last occurance of the macro, it is finally copied into an ordinary not redefinable label which can be used anywhere in the source.

h5	Define a macro with arguments

pre	<name> 	macro <name1> [ , <name2> … ]
			<instr>
			...
			endm

p 	Alternate syntax:

pre			macro <name> <name1> [ , <name2> … ]
			<instr>
			...
			endm

p	Invocation:

pre			<name> <some text> [ , <some text> … ]

p	This defines a macro with some arguments. Either of both definition styles are possible. Additionally there are different methods for defining and referencing the symbol arguments:

pre	foo:	macro A, B
			ld	&A, &B
			endm
	 
			macro foo, A, B
			ld	\A, \B
			endm
	 
	foo:	macro #A, #B
			ld	#A, #B
			endm
	 
			macro foo, #A, #B
			ld	#A, #B
			endm

h5	Argument processing in the macro definition

ul
li	Arguments are replaced by verbatim copies of the arguments in the invocation
li	A 'special character' before the macro name is required in the macro definition
li	The special character is either defined implicitely ('&' for <name> macro … and '\' for macro <name> …)
li	or it is defined explicitely py prepending it to the arguments (name macro <tag><name1>, <tag><name2> …)

p	Macro arguments can be inserted anywhere, even '#<name>' is allowed to occur in column 1 (if '#' happens to be your tag of choice). Possible tags are one of: "!#$%&.:?@\^_|~" but don't try to be too smart here, use of '&' is recommended.

p	Example:

pre	foo:	macro &A
			ld	b,&A
	foo&A:	ld	a,' '
			rst	8
			djnz	foo&A
			endm
	 
			...
	 
			foo	20
			...
			foo 8

p	In this example the argument is used as the second argument for 'ld b,N' and to construct a unique label name for each invocation. Obviously the passed argument must be a number literal else the label name thing won't work. A better solution would have been to use a redefinable label.


h5	Argument processing in the macro invocation

p	There are two methods for argument parsing, the standard 'clean & simple' one, and one for complex arguments.

p.b	Standard arguments

p	Arguments must follow the basic syntax rules: strings or character literals must be closed (balanced delimiters) and arguments end at the next comma, semicolon or line end. Brackets are not required to match.

pre		foo a, 1+2, a*(1+2)
		foo (, "hi, i'm Kio!", )	; 3 arguments

p.b	Complex arguments

p	Complex arguments start with an opening '<' and run up to the next '>' which is followed by a comma, a semicolon or the line end. With the help of the angle brackets you can pass unbalanced ''' and '"' or a comma or a semicolon as one argument to a macro. It is also helpful if you need to pass spaces at the start or end of an argument, or even just a space.

pre		foo	<,>, <;>, <">			; 3 arguments: , ; and "
		foo <<>, < >, <ld a,b>		; 3 arguments: < space and ld a,b
		foo	>, ><, 					; 3 arguments: > >< and nothing

p	There are still some impossible combinations, e.g. it is not possible to pass <b class=blue><>,</b> (3 characters) as an argument.


h5	Evaluation and literal text replacement of expresions
p.i	since versio 4.2.5

pre	L:      .equ  0         ; initialize redefinable label 'L'

	; calculate unsigned max
	; &A = umax(&A,&B)
	; usable for a and hl.

	umax:   .macro &A, &B
			and   a
			sbc   &A,&B
			jr    nc,L{L}	; e.g. L0 in first call
			ld    &A,&B
			jr    L{L+1}	; e.g. L1 in first call
	L{L}:	add   &A,&B
	L{L+1}:
	L		.equ  L+2		; next macro call will use L2 and L3
	        .endm


h5	Not implemented in macros:

ul
li	reference to arguments without a tag character
li	keyword 'local': try to use 'defl' instead. (not possible in all cases)

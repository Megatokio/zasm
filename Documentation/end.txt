p	Define the logical end of your source.

p	<tt>end</tt> must not be inside an <tt>#if</tt> branch or in a <tt>#local</tt> scope. This is so that using <tt>end</tt> does not disable the test for a missing <tt>#endif</tt> or <tt>#endlocal</tt>.

p	Anything after 'end' is ignored by the assembler.

p	This pseudo instruction is an alias for the assembler directive <tt>#end</tt>.

p	This instruction is optional.

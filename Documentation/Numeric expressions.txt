h3	Numeric expressions

p	The assembler has an expression evaluator which supports various formats for numbers and operators with priority order. You may also use brackets, but don't start an expression for an immediate value with an opening bracket. The assembler thinks that an expression which starts with an opening bracket indicates direct memory addressing. If you really need to start an immediate value expression with brackets, precede it with the '+' monadic operator or a hash '#'.

h4	Numeric literals

p	Numeric literals are the 'numbers' in an expression. They can be written in a multitude of formats:

pre	12345    decimal number
	12345d   decimal number
	$1234    hexadecimal number
	&1234    hexadecimal number  (since 4.3.4)
	1234h    hexadecimal number
	0x1234   hexadecimal number
	%1010    binary number
	1010b    binary number
	0b1010   binary number
	'a'      character literal

p	All number literals may be prefixed by a sign, either '+' or '-', which is actually handled as a monadic operator internally.

p	A character literal must be either a 7-bit ascii character or it is converted from utf-8. (note: all source files are expected to be either 7-bit ascii or utf-8 encoded.)
p	Character literals are translated to the target system's character set if the assembler directive '#charset' was used to define one. Else the character must be in range 0 to 255. If the character is not available in the target character set the assembler reports an error.
p	If the values are stored with 'defb' or similar, all values must fit in a byte each. Then characters like '€' will raise an error. If they are stored with 'defw' then '€' will be ok.

h4	Labels
p	Of course labels can be used in expressions. Labels may refer to local or global symbols, depending on whether they were defined inside the current #local context (if any) or outside any local context. See chapter '#local' for more information.

h5	Predefined labels
p	The assembler defines labels which can be tested with 'defined(NAME)' to test if certain command line options are set.
	The handling of these predefined labels changed slightly in version 4.3.4.

p	<b>_z80_</b> This label is defined if option --z80 is set on the command line or <u>after</u> the .z80 pseudo instruction. It is not set if target z80 is used by default.
p	<b>_z180_</b> This label is defined if option --z180 is set on the command line or <u>after</u> the .z180 pseudo instruction.
p	<b>_8080_</b> This label is defined if option --8080 is set on the command line or <u>after</u> the .8080 pseudo instruction. It is not set if target 8080 is used by default.
p	<b>_ixcbr2_</b> This label is defined if the option '--ixcbr2' was set on the command line or <u>after</u> the pseudo instruction '.ixcbr2'.
p	<b>_ixcbxh_</b> This label is defined if the option '--ixcbxh' was set on the command line or <u>after</u> the pseudo instruction '.ixcbxh'.
p.b	Note, that source line 1 is also used to set command line options if it starts with a shebang "#!".

h4	'$' and '.' (code address)
p	<b>'$'</b> and <b>'.'</b> are used to get the value of the current logical code position. It always refers to the start of a statement, e.g. to the first byte of an instruction or the postition of the first byte in a 'defb' instruction:

pre	foo:	djnz $		; jump to foo
	bar:	defb $,$,$	; stores 3x the value of bar

p	'.' is recognized for old sources only, do not use it in new code.

h4	'$$' (physical code address)
p	<b>'$$'</b> refers to the physical code position. For an explanation of 'physical' vs. 'logical' code position see instruction '.phase'.

h4	__line__
p	Inserts the current line number. E.g.:

pre	.macro abort
		ld	de, __line__
		jp	abort
	.endm

h4	hi() and lo()
p	<b>hi(NN)</b> gets the high byte of a 2-byte word. Similar to <tt>NN >> 8</tt>.
p	<b>lo(NN)</b> gets the low byte of a 2-byte word. Similar to <tt>NN & 0xFF</tt>.
p	Function names must be lowercase except if --casefold or --asm8080 is selected.
p	E.g. if you have a table which must be located completely inside a page, then you can automatically raise the table base if the table would cross a page boundary: (note: use a calculated expression for .align if the code address is not yet valid in pass 1.)

pre	.align hi($) != hi($+table_size-1)  ? 256 : 1
	table:	ds	table_size

h4	min() and max()
p	<b>min(N1,N2)</b> gets the value of the smaller of two values.
p	<b>max(N1,N2)</b> gets the value of the bigger of two values.
p	Function names must be lowercase except if --casefold or --asm8080 is selected.
p	You can also pass more than 2 arguments to min and max.
p	e.g. calculate size for a scratch pad:

pre	scratch: ds	max(fp_scratch,txt_scratch,gfx_scratch)


h4	sin() and cos()
p	<b>sin(ANGLE,N2,N3)</b> calculate the sinus of an angle.
p	<b>cos(ANGLE,N2,N3)</b> calculate the cosinus of an angle.
p	Function names must be lowercase except if --casefold or --asm8080 is selected.

p	The angle is scaled according to argument N2, which defines the value for a full circle. The result is scaled with argument N3. E.g. to generate a sine table with 256 values scaled to range ±127 use it in conjuction with pseudo instruction .rept:

pre	angle = 0
	.rept 256
		db	sin(angle,256,127)
	angle = angle +1
	.endm


h4	opcode()
p	Function 'opcode(…)' can be used to get the major byte of an opcode. This is useful if you want to poke an opcode byte into some self-modifying portions of code or to skip over the first 1-byte opcode of a second entry point to a subroutine with <tt>db opcode(cp a,N)</tt>, which is faster and shorter than <tt>jr $+3</tt>.

p	The 'major byte' is the first byte for most opcodes, the byte after 0xCB, 0xED, 0xDD or 0xFD for most others or the 4th byte of a 0xDD 0xCB or 0xFD 0xCB instruction. (note: 0xDD and 0xFD are the index register prefixes.)

p	'opcode' must be lowercase except if --casefold or --asm8080 is selected.

p	All opcodes for the Z80 cpu as well as the additional opcodes of the Z180 cpu are supported. If 8080 assembler is selected with --asm8080 then 8080 assembler mnemonics must be used.

p	Opcode names follow these rules:
p	• names should be in lower case
	• arguments can be:
	  • a register name: af, af', bc, de, hl, sp, ix, iy, pc, a, f, b, c, d, e, h, l, r, i
	    for xh, xl, yh and yl simply use h and l.
	  • a flag name: z, nz, c, nc, po, pe, m, p
	  • register indirect: (bc), (de), (hl), (sp), (c)
	  • index register with offset: (ix+N), (iy+N) and variants: (ix+dis), (iy+dis), (ix+offs), (iy+offs)
	  • immediate value and memory: N, NN, (N), (NN) and variants: dis, offs
	  • fixed values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 16, .. 56 and variants: $00, $08 .. $38, 0x00 … 0x38, 00h .. 38h

p	E.g.:

pre	db opcode(nop)				just the name for opcodes without argument
	db opcode(ld a,b)			name plus arguments which go into the opcode
	db opcode(bit 3,(hl))		'3' is part of the opcode!
	db opcode(rst 8)
	db opcode(ld a,N)
	db opcode(ld a,(NN))
	db opcode(ld a,(bc))
	db opcode(ld a,(ix+offs))	you can use 'ld a,(hl)' here as well
	db opcode(jr c,NN)
	db opcode(ex af,af')

p	Examples:
pre	; jump over an opcode:
		db	opcode(cp a,N)	; shorter and faster than 'jr'
	1$:	ld	a,e
	 
	; self modifying code:
		ld	(opcode1), opcode(inc l)
		ld	(opcode2), opcode(inc h)


h4	defined(LABEL)
p	This results in 0 or 1 depending on whether the named label is already defined at this position in source.
p	'defined' must be lowercase except if --casefold or --asm8080 is selected.
	<i>note: use of this function in a local context may malfunction if a local name of this name is defined after this test.</i>
	E.g.:

pre	#if defined(logline)
		ld	hl, __line__
		call	logline
	#endif

h4	required(LABEL)
p	This results in 0 or 1 depending on whether the named label was used but not yet defined at this position in source.
	E.g.:

pre	#if required(mul_hl_de)
	#include "lib/mul_hl_de.s"
	#endif

h4	target(NAME)
p	Test whether the named #target is selected. Use this if you made it selectable for some reason in your source. Result is 0 or 1.
p	Possible targets are: ROM, BIN, Z80, SNA, TAP, TAPE, O, P, 80, 81, P81 and ACE.
p	'target' must be lowercase except if --casefold or --asm8080 is selected.
p	Example:

pre	; include a tape header if #target is set to TAPE:
	#if target(TAPE)
	#code CODE_HEADER, 0, 17, headerflag
		defb    3, "mcode     "
		defw    code_size,load_address,0
	#endif

h4	segment(NAME)
p	Test whether the named segment is the currently selected #code or #data segment. Result is 0 or 1.
p	'segment' must be lowercase except if --casefold or --asm8080 is selected.
p	Example:

pre	; don't include 'ret' opcode if this is in boot code:
	#if !segment(GSINIT)
		ret
	#endif





h4	Operators
	operator priority, priority

p	The following operators are recognized and listed in order of precedence:

pre	brackets            ( ... )
	monadic operators   + - ~ !       	plus sign, minus sign, 2's complement, negation
	shifting            << >>       	shift left or right; left operand is target
	bit masking         & | ^			bitwise and, or, xor
						and or xor
	mult/div            * / %     	    multiply, divide, remainder ('\' is no longer recognized)
	add/sub             + -         	add, subtract
	comparisions        > < >= <= = <>	greater than etc.; result is 0 or 1
						== != eq ne
						gt lt ge le
	boolean				&& ||			pruning
	selector			? :				pruning

p	Since 4.0.21: The backslash '\' is no longer recognized as the remainder operation. The backslash is now used to separate multiple opcodes in one line.
p	Up to 4.0.22: The first argument of a pruning operator must be valid in pass 1.

p	Since 4.0.23: The first argument of a pruning operator should be valid in pass 1.
	If it isn't, then <u>both</u> sub expressions are evaluated in pass 1. If there is an undefined label referenced in a later pruned path it will be still required and the assembler will report it as undefined.

p	If you used command line option '--flatops' then all operators are evaluated strictly from left to right.

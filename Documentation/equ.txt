	named values

p	Named values:

pre	<name>[:][:] equ <value>

p	Frequently you start your source with a buch of definitions for const values, like printing control codes or port addresses. These definitions require a keyword after the label, in exchange a colon is never required, but may be present. 

pre	foo:	equ	255 -1
	bar		equ	255 -2
	shelf	equ	0xffff
	#define foobar foo & bar


p	You can append two colons '::' to the label name if you define a label inside a local context (after #local) but want to make it globally visible:

pre	#local
			...
	foo::	equ	$+2
			...
	#endlocal

p	Additionally zasm supports the use of the c preprocessor-style definition using '#define'. Labels defined with '#define' are always global.

p	For more information see the chapter about label definition.

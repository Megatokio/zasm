h3	defl, set and '='
	defl, set
	
p	Define a redefinable named value:

pre	<name>[:][:] set  <value>
	<name>[:][:] defl <value>
	<name>[:][:] = <value>

p	Labels defined with this keyword can be redefined at some later position.	
p	Especially for use in macros it is useful to allow labels which can be redefined to another value.

p	Example: define a macro which counts the occurances af something:
	Note: the final count is only valid after the last use of this macro in your source!

pre	foo		set	0
			macro COUNT
	foo		set foo+1
			endm

p	Example: use of a redefinable label in place of a program label:
	Note: forward jumping couldn't be implemented this way!

pre			macro WAIT
			ld		b,10
	foo		defl	$
			call	wait_1ms
			djnz	foo
			endm
			
p	The label's value is valid from the position where it was defined to the position where it is redefinedor the end of the source. References to this label <b>before</b> it's first definition are illegal!

p	For more information see the chapter about label definition.

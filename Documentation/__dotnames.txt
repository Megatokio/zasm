H5	--dotnames, .dotnames, _dotnames_
	dotnames

p	Related command line option, pseudo instruction and predefined label

p	Allow label names to start with a dot.
p	First dots were not allowed in label names. Then some assemblers prepended a dot to the pseudo instructions to easily distinguish them from normal instructions and label names, so they could start at any column of a source line. Having seen that, some people immediately developed the need to start their label names with a dot as well…
p	Normally, without this option, only pseudo instructions like '.ds' or '.org' can start with a dot. Then they may be written in any column of a source line regardless of the '--reqcolon' setting. 
p	With this setting the limitations described at '--reqcolons' also applies to pseudo instructions starting with a dot because the dot no longer makes them special and implicitely a non-label.

p	The following example is only valid source with --dotnames and --reqcolon:
pre	.org	0				; starts in column 0 => requires --reqcolon 
		.ds 0x66			; one of the original dot named pseudo instructions
		jp	.nmi_handler	; requires --dotname

p	Of course you could clean up your source as well…

p	If option --dotnames is selected, then the label _dotnames_ is defined and can be tested with 'defined(_dotnames_)' in expressions.

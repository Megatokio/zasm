H5	-c /path/to/cc   
p	If you include c sources and if the c compiler cannot be found in your $PATH or if you want to use a different one, then you can tell the assembler which executable to use for compiling c sources.
p	If a partial path is used then your current working directory applies.


H5	-t /path/to/dir  
p	Define the directory to use for temporary files. The only temp files created by zasm are those generated by the c compiler which will be stored in subdirectory 's/' inside this filder.
p	The default location is the output file's directory.
p	If a partial path is used then your current working directory applies.

H5	-I /path/to/dir  
p	Define the path to system header files for the c compiler. Normally the c compiler already knows where they are, but if you want to use a different directory or if your headers just are not in the standard location, you can use this option. It will pass two arguments to the c compiler:

pre	/bin/sdcc --nostdinc -I/path/to/dir

p	The first one tells it to forget about the standard location for header files and the second one tells it where they actually are.
p	If a partial path is used then your current working directory applies.
p	Note: include directories can also be added with the assembler directive #CFLAGS in your source file. There a partial path refers to the source file's directory!
p	Note: mind the space!

H5	-L path/to/dir  
p	Define the path to the system's library directory. This directory is used by zasm to resolve missing symbols in assembler directive '#include system library'.
p	The default location is derived from the include directory path. If the include directory path was not specified on the command line then the library path must be specified or '#include system library' won't work. But you still can hard code the path in the #include statement.
p	If a partial path is used then your current working directory applies.
p	Note: mind the space!

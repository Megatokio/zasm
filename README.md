## zasm

#### zasm - Z80, 8080 and Z180 assembler

You also need to checkout https://github.com/megatokio/Libraries. (uppercase 'L')
Project *zasm* already contains a symlink to '../Libraries'.

#### Features

_zasm_ accepts source code using **8080** and **Z80 syntax** and can **convert 8080 syntax to Z80**.
_zasm_ supports various historically used syntax variants and the syntax emitted by sdcc.

_zasm_ can generate binary files or Intel Hex or Motorola S19 files.
_zasm_ can generate various specialized files for **Sinclair** and **Jupiter Ace** and **.tzx tape** files.
_zasm_ can include the generated code and **accumulated cpu cycles** in the list output file.
_zasm_ can run **automated tests** on the generated code.

_zasm_ supports
- **character set conversion**, e.g. for the ZX80 and ZX81 and proper decoding of utf-8 in text literals.
- multiple code segments
- including and compiling of c source with sdcc. 
- **automatic label resolving** from libraries
- automatic **compression** using ZX7
- well known illegal instructions
- multiple instructions per line using '\' separator

the source can start with a BOM and with a shebang '#!' in line 1.
the source (text literals) must either to be 7-bit clean or utf-8 encoded.

#### New in version 4.4

Run automated tests on the generated code.

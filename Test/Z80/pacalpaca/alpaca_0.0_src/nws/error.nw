\chapter{System Errors}

This chapter describes how system errors are handled in \OS.

The System error routines are formatted similarly to the task
routines.  When the kernel finds an error during its interrupt
routine, it will push the correct address for the error routine
then return from the interrupt handler.

Each error routine should disable interrupts, clear the watchdog
timer, and draw some kind of informative information on the screen
for the user to see.

Errors are currently unimplemented.

\chapter{Development Schedule}

The development cycles for \OS have been broken down into a few phases.  
Each of the phases will be completed before then next one will be started.

\section{Phase 1}

    \begin{itemize}

	\item task startup with hardcoded entry points

	\item task switching with hardcoded priorites/delays

	\item init and process routines for tasks

    \end{itemize}


\section{Phase 2}

    \begin{itemize}

	\item task exec with ROM Task searcher 

	\item simple message queue (not useful)

    \end{itemize}



\section{Phase 3}

    \begin{itemize}

	\item task switching with wait(0), requested priorities

	\item more advanced message queue

	\item shutdown routine for tasks

	\item perhaps allow for multiple execs of the same process
		(this collides with the searcher's functionality)

    \end{itemize}

MAME Debugger commands

A [<update>]
        Animate (trace) and update display once per frame [or every <update> opcodes only]

D <1|2> <address>
        Display memory <1|2> starting at <address>

E <1|2> [<address>]
        Edit memory window <1|2> [at <address>]

M <1|2> [BYTE|WORD|DWORD]
        Change memory window mode to default [to BYTE|WORD|DWORD (or 0|1|2)]

F
	Fast

G [<address>]
        Go [and break at <address>]

J <address>
        Jump to <address> in disassembly window

R <register> <value>
        Replace <register> with <value> (<value> may also be a <register>)

BP, BPX <address> [<times>]
        Break on execution of <address> [after ignoring it <times>]

BC
	Clear execution breakpoint

RP <register> [<value> [<mask>]]
        Break if <register> changes [to <value> [compare after applying <mask>]]

RC
        Clear register watchpoint
WP, BPW <address> [<value>]
	Break if data at <address> changes [to <value>]

WC
	Clear data watchpoint

HERE
	Run to cursor

DASM <filename> <start> <end> [<boolean>]
	Disassemble to <filename> from address <start> to <end>
	Opcode dump on by default [OFF|NO|0 without]

DUMP <filename> <start> <end> [<data size> [<ASCII mode> [<prog/data memory>]]]
	Dump to <filename> from address <start> to <end>
	[data size BYTE|WORD|DWORD (also 0|1|2)]
	[ASCII mode OFF|TRANSLATE|FULL (also 0|1|2)]
	[PROG or DATA memory (also 0|1) for CPUs supporting it]

TRACE {<filename> [<reg1> [<reg2>...]]}|OFF
	Trace to <filename> [dumping <reg1> [<reg2>...]] | OFF to stop tracing.

SAVE <filename> <start> <end> [OPCODES|DATA]
	Save binary to <filename> from address <start> to <end>
	[either OPCODES (from OP_ROM, default) or DATA (from OP_RAM), also 0|1].

SCANLINE
	Toggles the display of scanlines

IGNORE <cpunum>
	Ignore CPU #<cpunum> while debugging or tracing

OBSERVE <cpunum>
	Observe CPU #<cpunum> while debugging or tracing

REPEAT rate
	Set keyboard initial repeat rate (rate/frame will increase to 1/frame)

CASE DEFAULT|LOWER|UPPER (also 0|1|2)
	Set disassembly case style.

OPCODES <boolean>
	Display opcodes in disassembly window

RELATIVE <boolean>
	Display relative jump addresses in disassembly window

SQUEEZE <boolean>
	Allow squeezed memory display

COLOR <element> <foreground> [<background>]
	Set <element> color to <foreground> on BLACK [or <background>].
	For a list of <elements> and <colors> see mamedbg.cfg
